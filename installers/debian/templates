Template: poseidon/controller_type
Type: select
Choices: BigSwitch Cloud Fabric, Faucet, Demo
Description: Select which SDN controller to use:
 Poseidon currently works with either a Faucet controller or a BigSwitch Cloud Fabric controller.  Please choose which controller will be used in this environment. Alternatively, you can choose Demo and it will setup Faucet, OVS, and Mininet to demonstrate Poseidon working with a virtual switch.

Template: poseidon/bcf_controller_uri
Type: string
Default: 192.168.0.10:8443
Description: IP or hostname and port of the BigSwitch Cloud Fabric controller:
 Poseidon will use the HTTPS API endpoint of BigSwitch Cloud Fabric to interact with the SDN network.  This endpoint will typically look like https://192.168.0.10:8443/api/v1/.  Supply the IP and port that the BCF API is running on and Poseidon will figure out the URL.

Template: poseidon/faucet_same_host
Type: select
Choices: Yes, No
Description: Will Poseidon be running on the same host as the Faucet controller?
 Poseidon needs to connect to the Faucet controller, if it's on the same host it will just connect directly, otherwise if they're on different hosts Poseidon will need to connect to the Faucet host over SSH.

Template: poseidon/faucet_controller_uri
Type: string
Default: 192.168.0.10
Description: IP or hostname of the Faucet controller:
 Poseidon will use SSH to connect to the Faucet controller if Faucet is running on a different host than Poseidon.

Template: poseidon/collector_nic
Type: select
Choices: List available network interfaces, Specify your own
Description: Pick how you want to specify the NIC for mirroring:
